# Primary data processing

I performed data cleaning and transformation, this is a fairly typical task for a data analyst and ML engineer, 
so I tried to do everything correctly especially for the portfolio.

## Job Description:

First, I checked the data for duplicates as well as missing values (null). To handle missing values, 
I used deletion of columns that were almost completely missing values and filled in the remaining values using the kNN method. 
Afterwards, I did an anomaly search using the clustering method (DBSCAN). In the data transformation step, I checked the variable type and fixed the variable type problem
